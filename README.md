# Regenerative-Breaking
## Abstract

Regenerative braking systems are a key technology for enhancing energy efficiency and promoting sustainable practices in the automotive industry. This project investigates the principles and functionalities of regenerative braking in electric vehicles through a comprehensive study and simulation. The research explores how kinetic energy is recovered during braking and converted into electrical energy for battery storage. The report reviews existing literature on the mechanism and advantages of regenerative braking systems. It then details the development of a MATLAB/Simulink model to simulate the system's operation. The simulation analyzes various parameters, including battery state of charge, electrical currents, torque, and machine speed. The analysis confirms the effectiveness of regenerative braking in recovering energy and highlights its potential to optimize energy usage and extend driving range. The successful simulation paves the way for further exploration and refinement of this technology, promoting the development of cleaner and more sustainable electric vehicles.
